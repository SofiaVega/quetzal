App for Technica Hackaton which is aim to promote the native indigineous language to be preserved and be equally reachable for all people who would like to learnt it and, with it, the indigineous communities culture.
The goal of this app is for the native language to be able to be learnt in a more didactive way. We eould like for this to be a didactic kind of documentation for the future generations to be able to learn it even if the community as it is disappears. We would like to record the community's culture and essence to remain.
