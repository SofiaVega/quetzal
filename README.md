App for Technica Hackaton which is aim to promote the native indigineous language to be preserved and be equally reachable for all people who would like to learnt it and, with it, the indigineous communities culture.
The goal of this app is for the native language to be able to be learnt in a more didactive way. We would like for this to be a didactic kind of documentation, learnable for the future generations. Even if the community disappear, we would like the community's culture and essence to remain.
